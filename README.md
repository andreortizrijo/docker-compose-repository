# docker-compose-repository
All my docker compose configurations for each service I ever used.

## How to run
To run a specific docker compose file use this command:
```
docker compose -f <DOCKER_COMPOSE_YML> up -d
```
PS> To run more than one file, just repeat the option (```-f <DOCKER_COMPOSE_YML>```) as many times as you need.
